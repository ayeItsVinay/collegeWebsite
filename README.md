# collegeWebsite

This is a simple college website built from scratch to just test my skills on HTML, CSS and JS.
It has a landing page with multiple sections which are designed to be crisp and minimalistic.
It has multiple pages like Contact, Blog, Course and About which only work as frontend and leaves room for adding your own utilities for the backend.

Finally, you can view a live demo of the app here: https://college-website-omega.vercel.app/index.html
